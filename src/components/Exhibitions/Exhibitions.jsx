        I'm an artist from Russia. I work in several directions, such as realism, impressionism, abstraction. I also studied the art of photography,
        graphics, sculpture, and mosaics. My paintings are filled with deep philosophical meanings about life and consciousness. I'm close to the idea
        of the multidimensionality of worlds and that God is around us and within us. I love music, nature, space. And of course, I love art. I
        participate in competitions and exhibitions and am constantly learning something new.
